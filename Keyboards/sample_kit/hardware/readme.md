# Keyboard Demo Kit

![](images/demo_kit_wiring.jpg)

To create the demo kit, we used MX blue switches and breakout boards available at Sparkfun.

For simplicity and to save time we didn't add LED's or populate the ghosting-prevention diodes (which is only needed if we want to be able to detect simultaneous button presses).

To start we simply solder all breakout board in the same row together by soldering a wire between the pins labeled **2**.
Then solder all the columns together with a wire between the pins labeled **1**. Only use the number **1** pins that are on the top and bottom of the breakout board.
Then solder the all audio Jacks middle pin together, and extend each row from the key matrix over to the audio jacks to the last pin (farthest from the jack).

*Note: row 2 only has 4 switches while row 1 and 3 have 5 switches.*

Use pro-micro pins 15, 14, and 16 for key matrix rows 1 - 3 respectively.
Use pro-micro pins 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 for key matrix columns 1 - 6 respectively.

For the vibrator motor, we forgot to design a transistor circuit to drive it. So we ended up just using two of the IO pins to drive the motor (this is not recommended but works in a pinch). The vibrator motor leads can be directly soldered to the pro-micro pins 5 and 6.

One of the face plate covers has a Sparkfun capacitive touch break out board, which just needs power, and the out pin wired to pin 20 on the pro-micro. Use a 3 pin JST jumper wire assembly to make it easily removable. Which will have the same function as the switch on row 1 column 4.
