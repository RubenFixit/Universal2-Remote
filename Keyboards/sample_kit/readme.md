# Adaptive Universal Remote Concept & Demo

This product was our first concept to have users at UCPLA try out.

It contained our sample_kit keyboard, that is a custom usb keyboard. It was designed to connect to a Raspberry Pi with a display that would host the [software](https://tangibletec.github.io/Adaptive-Universal-Remote/Keyboards/sample_kit/software/home.html). The software is just a website that has the option to send and post or get command to another device to control it. For more information on this you can check out the [YouTube concept presentation](https://youtu.be/PvSPvex815Y?t=615). We ended up keeping the display separate (variation 1) for our initial testing.
