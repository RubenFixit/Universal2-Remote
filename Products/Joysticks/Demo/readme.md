# Joystick Kit Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started

For this first test, we want to see if we can distinguish between different body positions with different users.  This test is intended to work with a computer/laptop to play simple arcade games.  As an example of what we are trying to accomplish, please watch this [video](https://youtu.be/SsOqFFKt7dk).

> Please note that while the joysticks have an internal battery, this demo is not very battery friendly, and the devices will only last for a few minutes (~15 min).

1. **Pair the joystick with a computer via Bluetooth.** Plug in the Atom (small grey unit) to the display unit. 
 * The device should already be paired. if not you can click on the bluetooth icon and add a new device. It will appear as bluetooth keyboard/mouse device (ESP32 Keyboard/Mouse). Select it and pair. Keep the Atom plugged in for the entire duration of use.

2. **Turn on the Joystick attached to the wristband.** Attach the joystick to a limb of the user that they feel comfortable moving. This can be the wrist, arm, leg, ankle, or even head. This can be achieved using the included wristband or the device can be taped to the user. The user can also simply hold the device if they wish.

3. **Turn on the second orange device.** This device is for calibration and changing game modes. When turned on, the interface should appear like the image below.

The secondary small button is used to change game modes.  By pressing the secondary button, the text will change as seen in the next image.

## Calibration

Anytime the user changes position or the device is given to a new user, the unit needs to be recalibrated.

To start the calibration, press the main button on the M5stick that shows "CALIBRATE? >".

Once started the screen will be display the position to hold Joystick 1 at, like so:

![](images/j2-cal.jpg)

Calibrate the M5stick for each of the 5 positions: **HOLD NORMAL**, **HOLD LEFT**, **HOLD RIGHT**, **HOLD UP**, and **HOLD DOWN**.

For each step:

 1. Hold Joystick 1 at the position shown.
 2. While the user is holding the joystick at the position, press the big button on the M5stick showing the position on the screen.
 3. Keep holding that position until the display turn green. (~2 seconds)
 4. Repeat until all positions are calibrated.

> **HOLD NORMAL** should be a neutral, comfortable resting position. The other positions can be whatever fits the user's mobility. These positions don't have to be exact, but they do need to be different enough from each other. Try to move in the general directions shown as it will make the games more intuitive.

## Game Modes

> You can also go to the Game page on the demo software to launch these games

Game Modes correspond to the following games and actions:

**Maze:** [https://www.happyclicks.net/maze-games/index.php](https://www.happyclicks.net/maze-games/index.php)

The positions left, right, up, and down are used to navigate through the mazes

**Pacman/Snake:** [https://elgoog.im/snake/](https://elgoog.im/snake/)          [https://elgoog.im/pacman/](https://elgoog.im/pacman/)

Similar to the Maze controls, but the response time is a bit faster.

**Space Invaders:** [http://thesimplearcade.com/play/space-invaders.html](http://thesimplearcade.com/play/space-invaders.html)

Left and right correspond to the side-to-side movement.  Up corresponds to shooting

**T-rex run:** [https://elgoog.im/t-rex/](https://elgoog.im/t-rex/)

Left corresponds to a T-rex jump.

The maze game is the simplest and most likely to work for users as it is not dependent on time. If it gets boring, try to see if the other games work as well.  If an individual does not have line of sight to play these games, please set the game mode to maze and test using a keyboard testing website such as this: [http://en.key-test.ru/](http://en.key-test.ru/). See if users can correctly hit different arrow keys, which will be highlighted in blue when hit.
