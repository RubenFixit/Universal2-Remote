## Setup Overview

## Initial Setup

The Adaptive Universal Remote is pre-configured to work out of the box with any Roku device that is compatible with an IR remote (including Roku Smart TV's). 

### IR Blaster

![](Images/IR_Blaster.png)The IR blaster has a short range (up to 10 feet) from the devices you are controlling. 

#### Placement

Place the IR Blaster with the red window facing the device(s) you would like to control. For best results place the IR blaster as close as you can to the other device(s).

In our tests, it worked best directly under the TV near the IR receiver with red window facing out. Some double sided tape (command strips) can be used to help keep the IR blaster in place.

#### Setup

If you are using this with a Roku Smart TV then no setup is required. Simply place the IR Blaster as instructed and use the keyboard just like any other Roku Remote.

*\*Note: There are 3 extra buttons not needed by a Roku Smart TV; Input Select, Channel Up, and Channel Down. While they are pre-configured to still be useful with the Roku TV, they can be reprogrammed for another IR device if desired.*

If you wish to use any other device, continue to the "Reprogramming Commands" instructions. 

*If using a TV with a Roku box you only need to reprogram seven buttons: Power, Input Select, Volume Up, Volume Down, Mute, Channel Up, and Channel Down.*

#### Reprogramming Commands

Any button on the keyboard can easily be reprogrammed to control any IR device with these two steps.

1. Hold down the brightness button (bottom left) and then press and release the button you want to reprogram. Release the brightness button. The keyboard will flash twice indicating that a button is ready to be reprogrammed.\
   \
   The IR Blaster window will also begin to flash a bright red every 1.5 seconds until it has learned the new IR command or another button on the keyboard is pressed.
2. Point the original remote at the IR blaster and press the button that you want the Universal remote to learn.

   The IR blaster window will blink red twice when it has learned the new command.

   The button you chose in step 1 has now been programmed with the new command.

That's it! Be sure to test this button to be sure it is working as expected. Repeat for each button as many times as needed.

## Settings / Features

### Keyboard

Each keyboard is paired to a specific IR blaster. If needed, you can compare the labels on the backs of the keyboard(s) and IR blaster(s) to verify the paired MAC addresses match.

##### On / Off Switch

The on-off switch is the small switch located on the back of the keyboard. Switch this to "OFF" when the devices is not in use. Otherwise, it can be left on. It is important to note that the keyboard will also not charge the battery if the switch is off.

##### Battery and Charging

The keyboard currently only has enough power to run for about 10 - 14 days before needing to charge depending on how frequently it is used. If the device is not going to be used for several days it is important to switch the keyboard "OFF" to prevent the battery from being damaged.

To charge the keyboard, simply plug a micro-USB cable into the back of the keyboard. Make sure the ON/OFF switch is in the "ON" position. The keyboard will take about 4 hours to fully charge.

##### Low Battery

If the battery is low, the backlight will only light up to the minimum brightness and the haptic feedback will be disabled. The keyboards backlight will also flash 3 times when waking it up, or attempting to change the backlight brightness.

##### Backlight Brightness

The brightness of the backlight can be changed by pressing the brightness level button in the bottom left corner of the keyboard. Each time the button is pressed it will increase in brightness. If the button is pressed after it has reached the maximum brightness, it will go back to the minimum brightness setting.

##### Haptic Feedback

The keyboard has a vibrator motor that can provide addition feedback to a user when a button is pressed. This can be turned on by setting the backlight brightness to it's maximum setting.

##### Power Saving

The keyboard will automatically go into a deep-sleep state after 60 seconds of inactivity or 10 seconds of inactivity when the battery is low. When asleep the backlight will turn off.

To wake up the keyboard you will need to press the skip-back or left arrow button. When awake the keyboard backlight will be on.

## Factory Reset

If at any time you want to restore the AUR to it's original configuration (stock Roku remote), you can preform a factory reset. This is done by holding down the brightness button and then the power button for 8 seconds. Both devices will start to blink, indicating that you can release the buttons. All learned commands will be forgotten and the AUR is once again configured as a Roku Smart TV remote.
